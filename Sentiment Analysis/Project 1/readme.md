# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on their textual content. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data collection, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Project Structure
- `Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing code, methodology, and results.
- `Sentiment Analysis.html`: Exported HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing.
- `description.txt`: Brief description of the project.
- `txt_files/neg/`: Folder containing negative movie review text files.
- `txt_files/pos/`: Folder containing positive movie review text files.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for visualization)

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - The dataset consists of movie reviews categorized into positive and negative folders.
   - Each review is stored as a separate `.txt` file.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Reading and aggregating all text files from both positive and negative folders.
   - Cleaning the text: removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and tokenization.
   - Optional: Stemming or lemmatization to normalize words.

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer) or TF-IDF.

4. **Model Building**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Training machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualizing confusion matrix and other relevant plots.

6. **Results & Interpretation**
   - Reporting the best-performing model and its metrics.
   - Discussing misclassifications and possible improvements.

## Results
- The best model achieved high accuracy in classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.
- The confusion matrix and classification report indicate strong performance, with most reviews correctly classified.
- Some misclassifications occurred due to ambiguous or sarcastic reviews, which is a common challenge in sentiment analysis.

## Conclusions
- Sentiment analysis using NLP and machine learning is effective for classifying movie reviews.
- Proper preprocessing and feature engineering are crucial for model performance.
- The approach can be extended to other domains such as product reviews, social media analysis, and customer feedback.

## Use Cases
- **Movie Review Aggregators**: Automatically classify and summarize user reviews.
- **Product Review Analysis**: Analyze customer sentiment for e-commerce platforms.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Track public sentiment on brands, products, or events.
- **Customer Support**: Prioritize and respond to negative feedback efficiently.

## Future Work
- Incorporate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for improved accuracy.
- Handle neutral and mixed sentiments.
- Deploy the model as a web service or API for real-time sentiment analysis.

## How to Run
1. Open `Sentiment Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to execute the analysis pipeline.
3. Review the results and visualizations in the notebook.
